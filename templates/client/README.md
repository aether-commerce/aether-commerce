# Client Store

This is a client implementation starter. It contains validated public store
configuration, extension points and app directories; it intentionally does not
copy Aether demo data, provider secrets or deployment resources.

1. Create it with `pnpm create:client <kebab-case-name>`.
2. Set `GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` to a GitHub Packages token with read access;
   the included `.npmrc` configures the scoped registry without storing a secret.
3. Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm validate`, then `git init`.
4. `apps/admin/` and `apps/storefront/` are real, deployable Next.js projects
   (App Router, `output: "export"`, their own `package.json`/`next.config.mjs`)
   wired together by the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - `pnpm --filter ./apps/admin build`
   (or `./apps/storefront`) produces a static `out/` directory for each.
   `apps/admin/app/{layout,page}.tsx` and `apps/storefront/app/{layout,page}.tsx`
   already render a working default skin - `@aether-commerce/admin-default` and
   `@aether-commerce/storefront-default` - wired to `config/`. Both directories also ship
   every business page as one-line re-exports, each in its own file under the
   matching route folder: `apps/admin/app/` has orders, products, customers,
   inventory, coupons, reviews, settings, activity, and system health;
   `apps/storefront/app/` has cart, checkout, account (favorites/orders),
   login/register, categories, products (catalog + detail), compare, and
   contact. Keep them as-is to use the default skin, or edit any individual
   file to design your own (you can still import individual pieces from the
   packages, or replace everything) - this is a per-file choice: keep the
   default admin panel while redesigning the storefront, replace one business
   page while keeping the rest, or vice versa. Store secrets only in the
   deployment platform secret manager. Both apps require
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` at build time (it's read at
   module-eval time, so the build fails fast without it, the same as this
   repo's own `apps/admin`/`apps/storefront`).
   - `apps/api/` is also a real, deployable Cloudflare Worker -
     `apps/api/src/index.ts` wires up `@aether-commerce/api-worker`'s `createApiApp()`
     (every commerce/admin/admin-chat route, already built) the same way this
     repo's own `apps/api` does. For local development, run
     `pnpm --filter ./apps/api db:migrate:local`. In production the deploy
     workflow creates or reuses D1 and writes the real account-specific ID
     to an ignored generated config; the checked-in config stays portable.
     It needs
     `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`/`CLERK_JWT_ISSUER` to authenticate admin requests;
     `AETHER_CART_TOKEN_SECRET`/`AETHER_SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for cart
     tokens and encrypted integration secrets; `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/
     `WOMPI_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_*`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`
     are each optional - every integration already degrades gracefully
     without its secret set, so only configure the providers you actually
     use. `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars` block also carries
     `STORE_CURRENCY`, `STORE_LOCALE`, `STORE_COUNTRY`, `BRAND_NAME`,
     `EMAIL_FROM`, `OBSERVABILITY_SERVICE_NAME`, and `AI_ASSISTANT_NAME` -
     override these to replace the "client-store" placeholders `create:client`
     already substituted. `apps/ai/adapter.ts` has no packaged default yet -
     implement it using its typed `adapter.ts`, `src/configuration.ts`, and
     the versioned `@aether-commerce/*` packages.
   - `apps/storefront/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx` and `categories/[slug]/page.tsx`
     ship `generateStaticParams()` returning a single `"example"` placeholder
     slug - `output: "export"` refuses to emit zero pages for a dynamic
     segment, and a fresh client has no catalog yet. Replace it with real
     slugs from your own catalog once you have one.
   - Privacy, cookies, terms, returns, and shipping pages aren't included -
     that content is genuinely yours to write, not something a starter can
     provide. `config/legal.ts`'s `legalPolicyVersion` (sent by the contact
     form and the AI assistant) is a placeholder until you add real pages.
5. `apps/storefront/wrangler.jsonc` and `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` each deploy
   their own Cloudflare Worker (`wrangler deploy`, or each app's own
   `pnpm deploy`) - the storefront's serves its static `out/` directory, the
   API's runs `@aether-commerce/api-worker` directly. The admin panel has no
   `wrangler.jsonc` of its own - deploy its `out/` directory to Cloudflare
   Pages instead (`wrangler pages deploy apps/admin/out --project-name=<name>`),
   the same split this repo's own `apps/admin`/`apps/storefront` use.
   `apps/ai/` is a configuration adapter only, not a deployable project yet
   (see point 4) - there is no AI Worker to deploy from this template until
   you implement one. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs all of this
   automatically on every push to `main` (see "Deploy" below).

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys all three apps on every
push to `main` (or manually via the Actions tab's "Run workflow"). Before
the first run can succeed:

1. In the repo's GitHub Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions, add:
   - **Secrets** (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are
     required - nothing deploys without them; every other one is optional,
     matching what each service already tolerates missing):
     `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
     `AETHER_CART_TOKEN_SECRET`, `AETHER_SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
     `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER`, `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
     `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `WOMPI_SECRET_KEY`,
     `WOMPI_EVENTS_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`,
     `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`,
     `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`.
   - **Variables**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (required - admin and
     storefront both fail to build without it); `ADMIN_PAGES_PROJECT` if you
     want a Pages project name other than `<name>-admin`;
     `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SUBDOMAIN` only when the account's workers.dev
     subdomain should not use the repository owner; `D1_LOCATION` to override
     the default `enam`; and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AETHER_BASE_PATH` only if the
     storefront isn't served from its domain's root. Optional custom-domain
     overrides are `NEXT_PUBLIC_AETHER_API_URL`, `APP_ORIGIN_STORE`, and
     `APP_ORIGIN_ADMIN`.
2. Push to `main` or run the workflow manually. The bootstrap is idempotent:
   it creates or reuses the D1 database, Pages project, and workers.dev
   subdomain, then generates `apps/api/wrangler.deploy.jsonc` for that run.
   The generated file is ignored and no Cloudflare account UUID is committed.
3. When you later attach custom domains, set the three URL override variables
   above. Without them, the first and subsequent deployments automatically use
   the stable workers.dev and pages.dev URLs returned by Cloudflare.

The workflow doesn't touch `apps/ai/` - there's no AI Worker to deploy yet
(see point 5).

## Aether updates

Add the repository secret `AETHER_PACKAGES_TOKEN` with read access to the
Aether package registry. After an Aether release is published, the distributor
sends an `aether-release` event to the client and starts **Update Aether
platform** automatically. The workflow always checks out `develop`, updates
every workspace dependency, synchronizes D1 migrations, validates the store and
opens a pull request against `develop`; it never overwrites client-owned
configuration or branding. The same workflow can still be started manually,
and Dependabot remains a weekly fallback if the dispatch token is unavailable.
Promote the validated `develop` branch to `main` through the normal production
pull request. The deployment synchronizes migrations once more before applying
them.

Versioned package changes (storefront/admin components, shared API behavior,
schemas and migrations) reach existing clients through that update pull
request. Generator/template files are intentionally not copied over an existing
client: workflows, `config/`, `custom/` and client-owned assets must be migrated
explicitly so an Aether release can never overwrite brand work or deployment
policy without review.

`config/` is public configuration (including `config/theme.ts` - colors and
fonts, separate from `config/brand.ts`'s name/logo); `custom/` contains
client-only pages, components, styling, animations and assets; `database/`
contains only client-specific extensions and optional seeds. The generator
also creates `database/migrations/` from the reusable Aether schema
migrations; it excludes the Aether demo's historical data migrations.
Keep `STORE_CURRENCY`, `STORE_LOCALE` and `STORE_COUNTRY` in
`apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` aligned with `config/store.ts`.

Never put provider secrets in `config/`; runtime secrets belong in the chosen
deployment platform's secret manager.

`tsconfig.validation.json` is used only by Aether's monorepo CI to resolve the
local unpublished package during template verification. Do not copy it to a
client repository.
